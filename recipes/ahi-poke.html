    <h1>Ahi Poke</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy poke recipe is a refreshing Hawaiian salad of fresh ahi tuna steak cubes tossed with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions for a dish full of umami flavor. I like to add chopped macadamia nuts even though they are not authentic â€” they add a delicious crunch! This makes 4 main course servings or 8 appetizer servings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>ahi tuna</li>
       <li>soy sauce</li>
       <li>sesame oil</li>
       <li>green onions</li>
       <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>
       <li>macadamia nuts</li>
       <li>crushed red pepper (optional)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Making poke is so incredibly easy. Simply combine all the ingredients in a bowl and allow it to marinate in the fridge for at least two hours. Serve as desired.</li>
        <li>We love serving poke in a poke bowl.</li>
        <li>Poke doesn't last that long because the fresh fish can start to go bad. So, poke is best eaten the day-of or the next day. However, you can store poke in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days.</li>
    </ol>
